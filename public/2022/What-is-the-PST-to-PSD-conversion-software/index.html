<h1 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h1><p>Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-Bitcoins"><a href="#How-to-get-Bitcoins" class="headerlink" title="How to get Bitcoins?"></a>How to get Bitcoins?</h1><p>First, you need to install a wallet on your computer or phone. Wallets keep track of your Bitcoin balance and allow you to send and receive bitcoins. There are many different wallets to choose from, but we recommend using Bitcoin Core or Electrum.</p>
<p>Once you have installed a wallet, you can buy bitcoins from exchanges such as Coinbase or LocalBitcoins. You can also receive bitcoins from friends or family members, or mine them yourself.</p>

<h1 id="Are-there-any-alternatives-to-PST-to-PSD-conversion-software"><a href="#Are-there-any-alternatives-to-PST-to-PSD-conversion-software" class="headerlink" title="Are there any alternatives to PST to PSD conversion software?"></a>Are there any alternatives to PST to PSD conversion software?</h1><p>Since Microsoft discontinued support for its Personal Storage Table (PST) file format in Outlook 2013, many people have been looking for alternatives to the popular PST to PSD conversion software. Luckily, there are a few options available.</p>
<p>The first option is to upgrade to Outlook 2016 or later, as Microsoft has continued to support the PST file format in these versions of Outlook. However, if you do not want to or cannot upgrade, there are some other options available.</p>
<p>One of the most popular alternatives to PST to PSD conversion software is Mailbird. Mailbird is a free email client that supports both the PST and PSD file formats. It also offers a number of other features, such as calendar integration, task management, and social media integration.</p>
<p>Another popular alternative is Thunderbird. Thunderbird is also a free email client that supports the PST and PSD file formats. It also includes a number of features, such as message encryption and customizable themes.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a more full-featured solution than either Mailbird or Thunderbird, you may want to consider Microsoft Office 365. Office 365 includes a number of applications, including Outlook 2016, which supports the PST file format. Additionally, Office 365 includes cloud storage and collaboration tools that can be used to share your emails and other files with others.</p>
